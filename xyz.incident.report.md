# Introduction

- **Objective**: Demonstrate how structured post-mortems lead to effective incident response and enhanced reliability
- **Agenda**:
  1. Company & Incident Overview
  2. Incident Response & Post-Mortem
  3. Root Causes & Lessons Learned
  4. Improvement Areas
  5. Recommended Corrective Actions
  6. Results & Impact

# Incident Overview

- **XYZ Inc.**: Leading cloud-based platform for enterprise clients
- **Incident**: Routine system upgrade led to a misconfiguration error
- **Impact**:
  - Critical features became inaccessible
  - High customer dissatisfaction
  - Immediate rollback required to restore service

# Incident Response & Post-Mortem

**Immediate Response**

- Rolled back to a stable version
- Engaged on-call DevOps team for swift resolution

**Post-Mortem Steps**

1. Cross-functional review (Dev, Ops, Support)
2. Root cause analysis (deployment script misconfiguration)
3. Blameless approach [(learn more)](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/) to foster trust and transparency

# Root Causes & Lessons Learned

**Root Causes**

1. Misconfiguration in deployment script
2. Inadequate change management
3. Communication gaps during the emergency

**Lessons Learned**

- Need comprehensive testing, including config checks
- Mandatory peer reviews and sign-offs
- Clear emergency communication protocols

}
</style>

<div class="slide-content">
<div>

1. **Testing & Validation**

- Automated integration/end-to-end tests
- Regular ‚Äúfire drills‚Äù to practice incident handling

2. **Change Management**

   - Peer reviews for production changes
   - Documented rollback procedures and approvals
   </div>

<div>

3. **Communication & Collaboration**

   - Defined escalation paths (using a [RACI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) for clarity)
   - Standardized incident channels (Slack, Teams)

4. **Kanban Board as a Service**

   - Centralized backlog/task management for cross-functional teams
   - Real-time visibility of work in progress and bottlenecks
   - More ‚Üì

# Kanban: Making Work Flow Smoothly!

**üéØ How Kanban Helps Teams:**

- **See Everything at a Glance** üìã  
  Tasks are clearly visualized in columns (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done).

- **Stay Focused** üéØ  
  Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits prevent overload and promote higher-quality results.

- **Find Bottlenecks Faster** üö¶  
  Easily spot where work is stuck, so you can resolve issues quickly.

- **Work Together Better** ü§ù  
  Transparent workflows foster collaboration and ensure everyone‚Äôs on the same page.

# Recommended Corrective Actions

- **Infrastructure as Code** [(IaC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html) & **Policy-as-Code [Terraform]** [(PaC)](https://www.terraform.io/use-cases/enforce-policy-as-code)
  - Automate checks for misconfigurations
- **Canary or Blue-Green Deployments** [(Martin Fowler)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html)
  - Test updates on a small subset to reduce risk
- **Enhanced Monitoring & Observability**
  - Proactive alerts, logs, and dashboards
- **Scheduled Retrospectives & Post-Mortems**
  - Continual improvement and knowledge sharing
